## Introduction

### EFI folders

This repo includes multiple EFI configuations for different macOS Versions.

| EFI               | Description                                                               | Type      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `EFI - HeliPort`  | Supports every macOS Version except Ventura, Require HeliPort app         | `Stable`  |

Download HeliPort app ¬ª</strong></a>

<summary><strong>üíª My Hardware</strong></summary>
<br>
These are the Hardware component I use. But this OpenCore configuation <strong>should still work</strong> with your device, even if the components are not equal.

Check the model of your WiFi & Bluetooth card. Intel cards should be compatible with itlwm (or AirportItlwm). If your card is from another manufacturer, please check if your card supports macOS. macOS Sonoma no longer supports Broadcom Wifi cards.

| Category  | Component                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel Core i5-8350U                  |
| GPU       | Intel UHD Graphics 620               |
| SSD       | WD SN520 512GB NVMe SSD   	   |
| Memory    | 20GB DDR4 2400Mhz                    |
| Camera    | 720p Camera                          |
| WiFi & BT | Intel¬Æ Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265*   |

<summary><strong>Root patch instruction for airportltwm</strong></summary>

What you need
- intel wifi card (of course)
- hackintool (for device path) + your favourite plist editor (in my case, OCAuxiliaryTools)

1. open hackintool and go to Pcie menu, look for intel wireless (in my case, Wireless 8260)
![‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏ñ‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏≠ 2024-12-26 ‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≤ 1 49 07 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93566ae7-5b73-47ba-8d26-b1241e8c8dda)

2. open plist editor (i'll use OCAuxiliaryTools), add device path (without #), then add the following device details

| Key   |      Data Type      |  Value |
|----------|:-------------:|:------:|
| IOName |  String | pci14e4,43a0|
| compatible |    String   | pci106b,117 |
| device-id | Data | A0430000 |
| device_type | String | Network Controller |
| model | String | BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter |
| name | String | pci14e4,43a0 |
| pci-aspm-default | Number | 0 |
| subsystem-id | Data | 17010000 |
| subsystem-vendor-id | Data | 6B100000 |
| vendor-xt | Data | E4140000 |

it should be like this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a7b1d5b-29a7-4740-aaba-9ce1eb661f3f)


after that, be sure to add amfi=0x80 in boot-args (for allowing OCLP root patch), then press save

3. download IO80211FamilyLegacy IOSkywalkFamily kext from [OCLP](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/tree/main/payloads/Kexts/Wifi) (currently, this repo already included and already setup, but you need to download once i drop it)

4. if you done the setup correctly, you should be able to install the OCLP root patch

![‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏ñ‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏≠ 2024-12-26 ‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏•‡∏≤ 2 36 01 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a44dd01-c7cf-4db5-8db7-e54683529687)

5. install the patch, then you can remove the spoof id (or add the # instead) and intel wifi should works without heliport
