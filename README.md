<summary><strong>üíª My Hardware</strong></summary>
<br>
These are the Hardware component I use. But this OpenCore configuation <strong>should still work</strong> with your device, even if the components are not equal.

Check the model of your WiFi & Bluetooth card. Intel cards should be compatible with itlwm (or AirportItlwm). If your card is from another manufacturer, please check if your card supports macOS. macOS Sonoma no longer supports Broadcom Wifi cards.

| Category  | Component                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CPU       | Intel Core i5-8350U                  |
| GPU       | Intel UHD Graphics 620               |
| SSD       | WD SN520 512GB NVMe SSD   	   |
| Memory    | 20GB DDR4 2400Mhz                    |
| Camera    | 720p Camera                          |
| WiFi & BT | Intel¬Æ Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265*   |
